## Introduction
With the large source of data collected from news and reports, as well as from our own database of companies, these data can be put together to predict the interest and urgency scores for investing in portfolio companies. 

Rather than making this a conventional classification problem, we have decided to utilize graph neural networks for node classification instead. This will help make better predictions as graph networks take into account connections between nodes to make more informed decisions.
